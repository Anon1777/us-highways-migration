if you're insane like i am and love roads and know how to code please follow this quick easy tutorial

1. open Google Maps [maps.google.com]
2. go to road you want to map
3. find out whether route is marked east/west or north/south
4. case 1: go to westernmost/southernmost point of route and right click and select "measure distance"
5. follow road along eastbound/northbound route (in case of multi-lane roads with dividers)
6. stop at every intersection with a numbered route
7. zoom out and log mile distance and kilometer distance rounded to nearest hundredth
8. follow the table template
